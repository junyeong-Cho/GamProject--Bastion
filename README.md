- Explanation of what the game is and how to play:

Here's the English translation of your description of the game:

Our game is a top-down tower defense game. Each predetermined stage features a specific number and type of enemies that attempt to destroy the fortress from the outside. If a certain number of enemies accumulate, the fortress will collapse and the game will end. Before the game starts, you can choose one item from the shop and select the stage you wish to play. Once the game begins, you can summon units by pressing a button at the bottom of the screen and drag units to merge them. Use the merged, strengthened towers to fend off the increasingly powerful waves of enemies.
