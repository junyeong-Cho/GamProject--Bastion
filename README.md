### Game Overview and How to Play

**Bastion** is a top-down tower defense game where you defend a fortress from waves of enemies. Each stage presents a specific number and type of enemies attempting to breach your defenses. If too many enemies accumulate, the fortress collapses, ending the game.

**Gameplay:**
- **Pre-game:** Choose an item from the shop and select a stage.
- **In-game:** Summon units using the buttons at the bottom of the screen. Drag units to merge them, creating stronger towers. Use these towers to fend off increasingly powerful waves of enemies.

**Controls:**
- **Tab:** Fast forward
